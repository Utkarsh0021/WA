When Pakistan raises concerns about issues with minorities in India, however, the government (in New Delhi) should not then say it is an internal matter,” Mr. Vankwani told The Hindu, urging both governments to promote more religious and cultural exchanges.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDespite ongoing tensions over the temple attack, and increasing ceasefire violations at the Line of Control, India and Pakistan continued traditional exchanges of information on New Year’s day according to previously signed agreements.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBoth countries exchanges lists of nuclear installation and facilities according to the 1988 Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between India and Pakistan that went into force in 1991. They also exchanged, through diplomatic channels, lists of civilian prisoners and fishermen in each other’s custody, as mandated by an agreement in 2008.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“India handed over lists of 263 Pakistan civilian prisoners and 77 fishermen in India’s custody to Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan has shared lists of 49 civilian prisoners and 270 fishermen in its custody, who are Indians or believed-to-be Indians,” a statement from the MEA said.</p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P23012\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport {Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Home from './Home';\r\nimport About from './About';\r\nimport T241 from \"./page/Page1\"\r\nimport P2412 from \"./page/P2412\"\r\nimport P2301 from \"./page/P2301\"\r\nimport P23012 from \"./page/P23012\"\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Switch>\r\n                <Route path=\"/\" exact component={Home} />\r\n                <Route path=\"/about\" exact component={About} />\r\n                <Route path=\"/T241\" exact component={T241} />\r\n                <Route path=\"/P2412\" exact component={P2412} />\r\n                <Route path=\"/P2301\" exact component={P2301} />\r\n                <Route path=\"/P23012\" exact component={P23012} />\r\n            </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport{NavLink} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Nav() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='nav'>\r\n            <div className=\"nav-bar\">\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/\" activeClassName='logo'>WA.</NavLink>\r\n                <div className=\"nav-right\">\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/qutoes\" className=\"about\">Qutoes</NavLink>\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/about\"  className='about'>About Us</NavLink>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Nav\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction Rgtg() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"rgtg\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"text\">Read Good, Think Good</h1>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Rgtg;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport App from './component/App'\r\nimport Nav from './component/Nav';\r\nimport Rgtg from './component/page/Rgtg';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n    <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\r\n        <Nav/>\r\n        <App/>\r\n        <Rgtg/>\r\n    </BrowserRouter>,\r\n\r\n    document.querySelector('#root')\r\n)"],"sourceRoot":""}
