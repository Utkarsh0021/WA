When Pakistan raises concerns about issues with minorities in India, however, the government (in New Delhi) should not then say it is an internal matter,” Mr. Vankwani told The Hindu, urging both governments to promote more religious and cultural exchanges.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDespite ongoing tensions over the temple attack, and increasing ceasefire violations at the Line of Control, India and Pakistan continued traditional exchanges of information on New Year’s day according to previously signed agreements.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBoth countries exchanges lists of nuclear installation and facilities according to the 1988 Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between India and Pakistan that went into force in 1991.
